# This project application was programmed using VS Code to build a React application. In the src folder that is where the components that were made for the app. It also holds the pages for the webite as well. 

# Components: Holds the navagation bar and image for the homepage. There cards that are below the hero section are also there as well. 

# pages: contains the folder for the SignUp, Social, and MarketShopping cart component. In the pages folder it has the Home, SignUp, Social, RegisterPage, and MarketPage2 pages. which are the 4 other main pages. 

# The marketplace and social media coding don't have much functionality and more so hardcoded in but gives a blueprint to what we were trying to achieve. The icons and buttons work but will more time they can be could have been implemented even further but due to time and the low number of works in our group we opted to get as much of the project done.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
